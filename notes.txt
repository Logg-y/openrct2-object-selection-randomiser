There's an index for each ObjectType
Loading something new into that index WILL change objects present in the game world:
	Paths: update existing
	Rides: fails (null) if trying mismatched object types (eg trying to load a drink stall over a food stall, a stall over a ride...). If object selection UI is still open, it will return normal values but not work
		Tracked rides: ride type doesn't change, but the vehicles on it WILL, which could be hilarious but also catastrophic
		Flat rides: most flat rides seem to run on vehicles, this replaces the vehicle of the flat ride which will continue trying to operate on its old mode with hilarious results
		Stalls: transforms existing stalls
	Park entrances: replaces
	Scenery: any item(s) present in the park remain loaded, but the rest of the group disappears. Oh, and whatever you replaced it with doesn't properly end up in the palette any more.
	
	
-> I can't mess with scenery research sets because I can't seem to add them to the scenery palette.

Researchables I can mess with:
	Just rides/stalls.
	
Non research items that can be messed with:
	Path bottom styles
	Queue bottom styles
	Path support styles
	Benches
	Lamps
	Jumping fountains
	Jumping snowballs
	Bins
	Park entrance styles

Notes on Associations:
	Blacklist object
	Object always comes with...
	Object cannot coexist with...
	
Rides are max 2047, most other things are max 255

Associations:
	Blacklist legacy objects
	Path: for objects with both stair/slope variants, will force all to be one type
	Path: for objects with both round/square variants, will force all to be one type
	Path: no invisible objects
	Path: disallow road because you can't build with it
	Ride: prevent classic and RCT2 versions of the same ride coexisting
